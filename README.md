The Driver Drowsiness Detection project aims to develop a system that can detect drowsiness in drivers and alert them to avoid accidents. The system uses sensors and cameras to monitor the driver's behavior, including eye movements, head position, and steering patterns, to determine if the driver is drowsy. Once the system detects drowsiness, it sends an alert to the driver, such as a sound or vibration, to wake them up and prevent accidents.

The outcomes of this project can be significant in terms of reducing the number of accidents caused by drowsy driving. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), drowsy driving was responsible for an estimated 91,000 crashes, 50,000 injuries, and 800 deaths in the United States in 2017 alone. By alerting drowsy drivers, this system can potentially save lives and prevent injuries.

Moreover, this project can also contribute to the field of machine learning and computer vision by demonstrating the effectiveness of these technologies in detecting and alerting drowsy drivers. The proposed model architecture can serve as a starting point for future research in this area, leading to the development of more sophisticated and accurate drowsiness detection systems.
